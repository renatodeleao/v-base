# v-eye

The `v-eye` package provides the a set of compound components to create a group of selectable items out of any component. You can see it as the baseline functionality for components like `tabs`, `button-groups`, `accordions`, `carousels` and possibily others.
In one line: it's [`Vuetify's` `v-item-group`](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/item-groups/) without all `vuetify` fuss attached. All props to them üôè

## Monorepo
- The generic primitive is developed under `lib`
- Playground is exactly what the name suggests
- In the future, accessible compositions base on `lib` will be made available via other packages with `v-eye` as dependency.
## Docs && Installation
- Please refer to [`lib` documentation](lib/README.md)
## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Colophon
- Credits to `Vuetify` for the idea
- Credits to headless ui frameworks like radix.ui or headless.ui for setting strong foundations on library "form"
- Built with `vue-cli` and its friends.
